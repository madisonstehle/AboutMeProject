                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Hi everyone! My name is Madison Stehle. From the quiz, you've gathered (hopefully) that I'm a transplant to Seattle! I had always wanted to move to the Pacific Northwest, so I packed up my two cats and drove 2000 miles to do so. I love to read, hike, and play music in the spare time I used to have before beginning Code Fellows. I've never done any coding or computer work outside of starting this program, so thanks ahead of time for bearing with me through this process!</p>

                <h3>Job Experience</h3>
                <p>Currently, and for the past several years, I've worked as a youth development counselor and career manager. I've worked with non-profits and government programs that aid young adults in overcoming barriers to success by providing guidance and access to support services.</p>
                <p>Roles I've held include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Youth Development Counselor</li>
                    <li>Employment Program Specialist</li>
                    <li>Youth Career Manager</li>
                    <li>Youth Job Developer</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>My primary goal right now is to make it through Code Fellows and become certified in full-stack development. After that, I would really like to help non-profits and programs create databases that are actually useful. Right now, lots of programs use Salesforce for tracking data, and that does not necessarily accurately reflect the needs of the programs. Long term, I would like to apply for a masters program in Computational Linguistics. I admire technology like Duolingo and Google Translate and want to be a part of the development of new linguistic technologies.</p>
